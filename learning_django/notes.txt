3.16 - FILE STRUCTURE
> wordcount:
 - settings.py: user management, templates, db-management, base directory, et cetera.
 - urls.py: the structure of your website
 - wsgi.py: come back to that later in course
> db.sqlite3: database
> manage.py: do not touch it unless you really know what you're doing

3.17 - URLs
To create a page:
 - create views.py if it not yet exists
 - add 'from . import views' to urls.py
 - add the page to views.py and to urlpatterns (e.g. path('', views.home),)

3.18 - TEMPLATES
Continuing, to create a page:
 - create a folder templates if it not yet exists
 - add the folder name to settings.py > TEMPLATES > DIRS
 - create a html-file in this folder
 - add 'from django.shortcuts import render' to views.py

3.19 FORMS
If you name a page (e.g. path('count/', views.count, name='counting') in urls.py), you can refer to it in html (e.g. "{% url 'counting' %}")

3.20 COUNTING THE WORDS
You can pass the GET to a dict (e.g.
def count(request):
    return render(request,
                  'count.html',
                  {'fulltext': request.GET['fulltext']})
)
You can call a dict value on your html page (e.g. {{ fulltext }})
You can use python code on your page by putting in between {% python code %}
